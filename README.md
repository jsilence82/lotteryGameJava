# lotteryGameJava
A text based lottery game written in Java.

I had written a lottery game in Python and used that as a learning exercise to build a similar program in Java.
Produces 7 lottery numbers (without duplicates) and checks it against user inputed numbers. Also includes a $1 Million payout.
